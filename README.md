Windows application to illustrate how image registration works given a known set of correspondence points. I added some noise to illustrate how this affects the transformation found by setting the cost function to zero and solving for it.

The important files here are RegistrationTools.cs and Transformation.cs (for the sake of understanding the mapping).
